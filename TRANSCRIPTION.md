# AutoChar Studio Audio Transcription

AutoChar Studio includes a built-in audio transcription feature that allows you to transcribe audio files to text without any external dependencies. The transcription engine is self-contained within the application, so users don't need to install any additional software or models.

## Features

- Transcribe audio recordings directly within the app
- Supports multiple audio formats
- Uses Whisper AI for high-quality transcription
- No internet connection required - works offline
- No external dependencies needed

## For Users

When you download and install AutoChar Studio, the audio transcription feature is ready to use immediately. You don't need to:
- Install any external software like FFmpeg
- Download model files
- Configure any settings

Simply upload an audio file through the interface, and the app will handle the transcription automatically.

## For Developers

The transcription system is designed to be robust and self-contained:

1. It includes bundled Whisper model files in the app package
2. It uses direct binary execution of whisper-cli as the primary method
3. It has multiple fallback methods if the primary method fails
4. It includes comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting

To verify the setup is working correctly, run:

```
npm run verify
```

This will check that all required components are available and correctly configured.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with transcription:

1. Check that your audio file is in a supported format (WAV, MP3, etc.)
2. Try a different audio file to rule out file-specific issues
3. Check the app logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements for running the app

For developers, see the detailed error logs in the console output for specific error messages.
